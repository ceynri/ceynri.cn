### Techology

ceynri.cn v2 is powered by [Gridsome](https://gridsome.org), which is a Vue-powered Static Site Generator inspired by [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/).

The comment system currently uses [giscus](https://github.com/laymonage/giscus), a plugin similar to [utterances](https://github.com/utterance/utterances) but uses discussions instead of issues.

Automatic update deployment via [Github Action](https://github.com/ceynri/ceynri.cn/actions).
